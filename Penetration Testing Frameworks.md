## 1. Introduction

A penetration test is a structured security assessment designed to identify and validate weaknesses in systems, networks, applications, or other digital assets.

However, penetration testing is not simply about running tools against a target. A professional assessment requires planning, clear boundaries, systematic testing, evidence collection, and a final report.

A **penetration testing framework** provides a structured methodology or set of guidelines for conducting security assessments.

Imagine a building inspector checking a building. Instead of examining random areas, the inspector follows a checklist to ensure that important components are not overlooked.

Penetration testers use frameworks for a similar reason: they help organize the assessment and make the results more consistent and useful.

### Learning Objectives

By studying this topic, you should be able to:

- Explain why penetration testing frameworks are important.
- Describe the purpose of major testing methodologies.
- Compare frameworks by scope and intended use.
- Select a suitable framework for a particular assessment.
- Explain how MITRE ATT&CK complements penetration testing methodologies.

## 2. Why Use a Testing Framework?

Using a recognized framework can improve the quality of a security assessment in several ways.

### 2.1 Thoroughness

A structured methodology helps testers examine the relevant attack surface systematically.

Without a methodology, a tester might run several scans but forget network mapping, skip important checks, or overlook an exposed service.

### 2.2 Consistency

A framework helps different testers follow a common process. This makes assessments easier to repeat and compare.

### 2.3 Compliance

Organizations may need to demonstrate that their security assessments follow recognized standards, contractual requirements, or applicable regulations.

A framework can help structure the assessment and document the work performed. However, using a framework alone does not automatically guarantee regulatory compliance.

### 2.4 Clear Communication

A structured assessment produces more understandable results for technical teams, managers, auditors, and clients.

A useful report should explain what was discovered, why it matters, what evidence supports the finding, and how the issue can be addressed.

### 2.5 Defined Scope and Boundaries

Before testing begins, the tester must understand which systems are authorized for assessment and which activities are permitted.

Scope definition helps prevent accidental testing of unrelated systems and reduces legal and operational risks.

**Important:** Always obtain appropriate authorization and follow the agreed rules of engagement before conducting security tests.

## 3. Major Penetration Testing Frameworks

Different frameworks serve different purposes. No single framework is the best choice for every engagement.

| Framework | Primary focus |
|---|---|
| OSSTMM | Structured, metrics-driven security testing |
| OWASP WSTG | Web application security testing |
| NIST SP 800-115 | Technical security testing and assessment guidance |
| PTES | End-to-end penetration testing methodology |
| ISSAF | Information systems security assessment methodology |
| MITRE ATT&CK | Knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques |

MITRE ATT&CK is best understood as a complementary knowledge base rather than a complete penetration testing methodology.

## 4. OSSTMM

**Full name:** Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual

**Official resource:** [OSSTMM — ISECOM](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf)

OSSTMM is a security testing methodology that emphasizes a structured, scientific approach and measurable results.

Rather than relying only on subjective opinions, it focuses on evaluating security through defined testing procedures and metrics.

### Key Characteristics

- Structured security testing.
- Repeatable testing procedures.

- Evaluation of relevant operational security channels.
- Evidence-based assessment.

### When Is It Useful?

OSSTMM may be useful when an organization needs a systematic security assessment with measurable results.

**Remember:** OSSTMM emphasizes measurement and a structured approach to security testing.

## 5. OWASP WSTG

**Full name:** OWASP Web Security Testing Guide

**Official resources:**
- [OWASP WSTG — Main Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/)
- [OWASP WSTG — Version 4.2](https://wstg.owasp.org/v4.2/2-Introduction/)

The OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG) provides guidance for testing the security of web applications and web services.

It helps testers organize their work and investigate common web application security weaknesses.

### Key Characteristics

- Web application security testing.

### Further Reading

Explore the official [OWASP Web Security Testing Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/) to learn about its testing categories and techniques.

## 6. NIST SP 800-115

**Full name:** Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment

**Official resource:** [NIST SP 800-115](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/115/final)

NIST Special Publication 800-115 provides guidance for planning and conducting technical information security tests and assessments.

It discusses how organizations can structure testing activities, analyze findings, and develop recommendations.

### Key Characteristics

- Technical security testing guidance.
- Assessment planning.
- Testing and examination techniques.
- Analysis of findings.
- Recommendations for improving security.

### When Is It Useful?

NIST SP 800-115 can be useful to organizations that need documented procedures for technical security assessments.

It is particularly relevant when a client or organization uses NIST guidance as part of its security program.

**Remember:** NIST SP 800-115 is a technical guide for security testing and assessment, not merely a list of vulnerabilities.

## 7. PTES

**Full name:** Penetration Testing Execution Standard

**Official resource:** [PTES — Penetration Testing Execution Standard](http://www.pentest-standard.org/)

PTES provides a structured approach to the stages of a penetration testing engagement.

It focuses on organizing the assessment from preparation through testing and reporting.

### Commonly Recognized PTES Phases

1. Pre-engagement interactions.
2. Intelligence gathering.
3. Threat modeling.
4. Vulnerability analysis.
5. Exploitation.
6. Post-exploitation.
7. Reporting.

### Why Is PTES Useful?

A penetration test involves more than finding a vulnerability. The tester must understand the client's requirements, gather information, evaluate possible weaknesses, validate findings safely, and communicate the results.

PTES helps organize these activities into a coherent engagement.

**Remember:** PTES focuses on the overall execution and lifecycle of a penetration test.

## 8. ISSAF

**Full name:** Information Systems Security Assessment Framework

ISSAF is a historically influential framework for assessing information systems security.

It provides a structured approach to security assessment activities and discusses techniques associated with different stages of an assessment.

### Key Characteristics

- Information systems security assessment.
- Structured assessment activities.
- Technical testing guidance.
- A methodology for organizing assessment work.

### When Is It Useful?

ISSAF can be useful when studying established security assessment methodologies and understanding how structured assessments have been organized.

**Note:** ISSAF is an older framework. Check the condition and relevance of individual resources before relying on them for a current engagement.

## 9. MITRE ATT&CK

**Official resource:** [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/)

MITRE ATT&CK is a knowledge base describing adversary behavior through tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

It helps security professionals use a common vocabulary when discussing attacker behavior.

### 9.1 Tactics

**Tactics** describe an adversary's goal or the reason for performing an action.

For example, an adversary may attempt to gain initial access to a system.

### 9.2 Techniques

**Techniques** describe how an adversary may achieve a particular tactical objective.

A technique provides more detail about the method used to perform an activity.

### 9.3 How ATT&CK Complements Penetration Testing

A penetration testing methodology helps organize the assessment. ATT&CK can help classify and communicate the adversary behaviors represented by observed or simulated activities.

This can make findings easier to compare with known attacker behaviors and can help defensive teams consider relevant detection opportunities.

### Important Distinction

| Penetration testing methodology | MITRE ATT&CK |
|---|---|
| Organizes assessment activities | Describes adversary behaviors |
| Helps structure testing | Provides tactics and techniques |
| Supports assessment planning and execution | Supports threat analysis and security mapping |

**Remember:** In the ATT&CK matrix, columns generally represent tactics, while techniques are listed under the relevant tactics.

Explore the [MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base](https://attack.mitre.org/) for official definitions and technique references.

## 10. Other Notable Frameworks

Some assessments require specialized guidance because of the technology being tested or the industry in which the client operates.

### 10.1 WASC Threat Classification

**Resource:** [WASC](https://projects.webappsec.org/)

WASC Threat Classification is associated with the classification of threats and attacks affecting web applications.

It can help security professionals discuss web application threats using a structured classification.

### 10.2 CSA Cloud Controls Matrix

MASTG provides guidance for assessing the security of mobile applications.

It is relevant when testing mobile application behavior, storage, communication, platform interaction, and other mobile-specific security concerns.

### 10.4 PCI DSS Penetration Testing Guidance

**Official resource:** [PCI Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/)

PCI DSS is a security standard for environments that store, process, or transmit payment card data.

Organizations subject to PCI DSS requirements may need penetration testing that meets the applicable requirements and guidance.

Use the official PCI Security Standards Council resources to verify the requirements relevant to a particular assessment.

### 10.5 CBEST

**Reference:** [Bank of England — CBEST](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability/financial-sector-continuity)

CBEST is associated with intelligence-led penetration testing in the UK financial sector.

It is a specialized approach intended for its relevant financial-sector context, rather than a general-purpose methodology for every organization.

> **Note:** Specialized frameworks and standards can change. Consult their official publications for current scope, versions, and requirements.

## 11. Choosing the Right Framework

Framework selection should be based on the target, the client's objectives, the assessment scope, and any applicable regulatory requirements.

| Assessment scenario | Relevant resource |
|---|---|
| Web application security assessment | OWASP WSTG |
| Mobile application security assessment | OWASP MASTG |
| End-to-end penetration testing engagement | PTES |
| Measurable, structured security testing | OSSTMM |
| Technical security testing and assessment planning | NIST SP 800-115 |
| Understanding and classifying adversary behavior | MITRE ATT&CK |
| Cloud security controls assessment | CSA CCM |
| Payment card environment | Applicable PCI DSS requirements and guidance |
| Specialized UK financial-sector testing | CBEST |

These are starting points, not exclusive choices. A real assessment may use several complementary resources.

For example, an e-commerce application assessment might use WSTG for web application testing, relevant PCI DSS requirements for the payment environment, and ATT&CK to classify selected adversary behaviors.

### A Simple Selection Process

1. Define the assessment scope.
2. Identify the technology being tested.
3. Understand the client's objectives.
4. Identify relevant regulatory or contractual requirements.
5. Select an appropriate methodology and supporting references.
6. Document the work and report the findings.

Always confirm authorization, testing boundaries, and permitted techniques before beginning.
